## Enduring Mystery

This is a freetime webshop project i have built from the ground, with help of the NextJS framework, along with our languages including:

```bash
SCSS - CSS
TypeScript - JavaScript
```

The theme of the webshop is a mysterious company dubbed "Enduring Mystery" who specializes in scouting, collecting, and selling mysterious artifacts throughout the whole world.
Frontend is the main-part of this project. The backend is yet to be configured, designed and programmed. Although there are possible plans for the database to rely on Firebase or MongoDB.
